- Background task management
- Real-time status updates

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Basic Features (High Priority)

1. **Add Image Upload Component**
```typescript
// Add to GenerationPanel.tsx
const ImageUpload: React.FC = () => {
  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    accept: {
      'image/*': ['.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg']
    },
    onDrop: (files) => {
      // Handle image upload
    }
  });
  // Implementation...
};
```

2. **Implement Mode Selector**
```typescript
// Add mode switching to App.tsx
const [generationMode, setGenerationMode] = useState<'text2img' | 'img2img' | 'inpaint' | 'superres'>('text2img');
```

3. **Add Missing API Endpoints**
```python
# Add to main.py
@app.post("/generate/super-resolution")
async def super_resolution_endpoint(...)

@app.post("/generate/inpainting")
async def inpainting_endpoint(...)
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

1. **Mask Drawing Component**
   - Investigate React canvas libraries
   - Implement drawing tools
   - Add brush controls

2. **Image Preview and Editing**
   - Add image cropping
   - Implement zoom and pan
   - File validation and optimization

### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization (Low Priority)

1. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Add more animations
   - Improve loading states
   - Better responsive design

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Batch processing
   - History and favorites
   - Advanced parameter presets

## Conclusion

**Current React UI Coverage: ~60%** of Gradio functionality

**Strengths:**
- Superior text-to-image generation interface
- Advanced system monitoring and memory management
- Professional UI/UX with modern design
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Full API integration with real-time status

**Missing Critical Features:**
- Image-to-image generation mode
- Inpainting with mask drawing
- Super-resolution mode
- Multi-mode interface

**Recommendation:**
The React UI provides a strong foundation with significant improvements over Gradio in terms of system monitoring, memory management, and user experience. However, to achieve feature parity, the missing image-based generation modes need to be implemented.

**Priority Order:**
1. Add mode selector and image upload components
2. Implement image-to-image mode (API exists)
3. Add super-resolution mode (new API needed)
4. Implement inpainting mode (complex, requires mask editor)

**Timeline Estimate:**
- Phase 1 (basic features): 2-3 days
- Phase 2 (advanced features): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3 (polish): 1 week

The current React implementation successfully demonstrates the architectural improvement and provides a solid foundation for the complete feature set.
