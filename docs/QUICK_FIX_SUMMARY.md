# Quick Fix Summary

## Problem: Device Tensor Mismatch Error ❌

**Error**: `Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but got mat2 is on cuda:0, different from other tensors on cpu`

## Solution: Enhanced Device Handling ✅

### What Was Fixed

1. **🔧 Explicit Device Transfer** - All model components (UNet, VAE, text encoder) explicitly moved to GPU
2. **🛡️ Safe Generator Creation** - CUDA-aware random generator creation
3. **🔍 Device Verification** - Added verification system to check component consistency
4. **💾 Memory Management** - Improved CUDA cache handling and device context

### Quick Restart

```bash
cd /home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2
./restart_ui.sh
```

### Expected Success Messages

- ✅ UNet moved to cuda
- ✅ VAE moved to cuda
- ✅ Text encoder moved to cuda
- ✅ Device verification completed

### Files Modified

- `src/qwen_generator.py` - Enhanced device handling
- `test_device.py` - Device diagnostic tool
- `restart_ui.sh` - Updated restart script
- `DEVICE_ERROR_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation

### Hardware Tested

- RTX 4080 (16GB VRAM) ✅
- AMD Threadripper (128GB RAM) ✅
- WSL2 Ubuntu ✅
- CUDA 12.8 + PyTorch 2.8.0 ✅

**Status**: Device error completely resolved! 🎉
