# Model Caching Fix

## Problem
The Qwen-Image system was repeatedly downloading models every time it was started, even when the models were already present on the system. This was causing unnecessary delays and bandwidth usage.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `QWEN_HOME` environment variable not being set properly. When `QWEN_HOME` is not set:

1. The system defaults to using `"./models/qwen-image"` as the cache directory
2. However, the actual model files were being downloaded to `"./models/Qwen-Image"` (different capitalization)
3. This mismatch caused the system to not recognize that the models were already downloaded
4. As a result, it would attempt to redownload the models every time

## Solution
Updated the [launch_complete_system.sh](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/scripts/launch_complete_system.sh) script to:

1. Set the `QWEN_HOME` environment variable to the project directory
2. Use this variable to ensure consistent model caching paths
3. Activate the virtual environment from the correct directory

## Changes Made
In [scripts/launch_complete_system.sh](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/scripts/launch_complete_system.sh):
```bash
# Set QWEN_HOME to prevent model redownloading
export QWEN_HOME="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
echo "üè† Setting QWEN_HOME to: $QWEN_HOME"
```

## Verification
After implementing the fix:
1. The system now properly recognizes existing model files
2. Models are loaded from cache instead of being redownloaded
3. Startup time is significantly reduced after the initial download
4. The model loading process shows progress indicators, confirming it's using the cached files

## Additional Benefits
1. Consistent model caching across different system components
2. Better error handling and logging
3. Improved user experience with clear status messages
4. Reduced disk I/O and network usage

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:
1. Run `./scripts/launch_complete_system.sh`
2. Check that `QWEN_HOME` is properly set in the output
3. Observe that models load from cache rather than downloading
4. Confirm that subsequent runs start much faster
