## Testing and Validation

All improvements have been thoroughly tested:
- Unit tests in test_improvements.py
- Integration testing with improvements_demo.py
- Manual verification of all new functionality
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Lower Maintenance**: Centralized device policy reduces code duplication
2. **Higher Reliability**: Retry mechanisms and graceful error handling
3. **Better User Experience**: Proactive checks and clear guidance
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: PowerShell scripts for Windows users
5. **Memory Safety**: Proper cleanup and memory management
6. **Performance Optimization**: VRAM-aware image sizing
7. **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable cache locations
8. **Stable Backends**: Reliable attention implementation selection

## Usage Instructions

The improvements are automatically active when using the system. Key user-facing changes include:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   export QWEN_HOME=/path/to/fast/storage  # Linux/macOS
   $env:QWEN_HOME="D:\fast-ssd\qwen-models"  # Windows PowerShell
   ```

2. **Model Loading**:
   The system now automatically performs pre-flight checks, selects optimal configurations, and loads models with retry protection.

3. **Safe Operations**:
   ```python
   generator.switch_to_model("new/model/name")  # Safe model switching
   ```

4. **Cross-Platform Scripts**:
   - `./scripts/launch_ui.ps1` for Windows users
   - `./scripts/setup.ps1` for Windows setup
   - `./scripts/safe_restart.ps1` for Windows safe restart

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly, and maintainable foundation for the Qwen-Image generator system.
