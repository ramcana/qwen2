# Dependency Resolution Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to resolve dependency conflicts and testing issues in the Qwen-Image project.

## Issues Identified

1. **xformers/torch version conflict**: xformers==0.0.27.post2 was incompatible with torch==2.3.1
2. **Docker dependency conflicts**: Missing explicit PyTorch CUDA installation
3. **Conda environment issues**: cudatoolkit package not found in conda channels
4. **Local installation conflicts**: Dependency resolution issues in virtual environment

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed xformers/torch Version Conflict

**Files Modified:**
- [requirements.txt](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/requirements.txt)
- [constraints.txt](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/constraints.txt)

**Change:**
- Updated xformers from `0.0.27.post2` to `0.0.27` to ensure compatibility with torch 2.3.1

### 2. Improved Dockerfile for Better Dependency Resolution

**File Modified:**
- [Dockerfile.cuda](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/Dockerfile.cuda)

**Changes:**
- Added explicit PyTorch installation with CUDA support after the main dependency installation
- Used `--no-deps` flag to prevent dependency conflicts

### 3. Fixed Conda Environment Configuration

**File Modified:**
- [environment.yml](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/environment.yml)

**Changes:**
- Reordered channels to prioritize nvidia channel
- Added conda-forge channel for better package availability
- Updated cudatoolkit to cuda-toolkit=12.1

### 4. Updated Local Installation Scripts

**File Modified:**
- [scripts/setup.sh](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/scripts/setup.sh)

**Changes:**
- Pinned exact versions for PyTorch installation
- Replaced individual package installations with single command using requirements.txt and constraints.txt

### 5. Enhanced CI Workflow Documentation

**File Modified:**
- [.github/workflows/ci.yml](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/ramji_t/projects/Qwen2/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

**Changes:**
- Added comments explaining the dependency resolution approach
- Verified the workflow uses requirements.txt and constraints.txt for consistent dependency management

## Testing Verification

All changes have been made to ensure:
1. Dependency versions are consistent across all installation methods
2. CUDA support is properly configured for PyTorch
3. xformers and torch versions are compatible
4. Conda environments can be created successfully
5. Docker images build without dependency conflicts
6. CI workflows pass with the updated dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Test Docker build with updated configuration
2. Verify conda environment creation
3. Test local installation with updated scripts
4. Run full CI workflow to ensure all tests pass
